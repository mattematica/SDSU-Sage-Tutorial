--------------------------------------------------------------

"Sage Tutorial":  A web tutorial that seeks to introduce
undergraduates to the Sage computer algebra system (http://www.sagemath.org)

for details.

To process the mathematics in the tutorial we have used LaTeXMathML.js

version 1.47  (c) Peter Jipsen 2005. See COPYING.LaTeXMathML.

Installation:

All of the source code required to run the website are included in the
source directory. To install, just copy the entire directory somewhere
where your webserver can access it. Or the user can open index.html
directly in their browser. 

Development:

Adding Content
--------------------------

All content is contained in the content.xml file. The basic hierarchy is as follows

    <document> 
    	       <category   title=" " label="" >
	       		   <chapter title=" " label=" " >
		    	      	    <section title=" " label=" " >
			      	    </section> 
		    	</chapter > 					    
		    </category>
	</document>

Adding a new chapter or section to content.xml will automatically be
reflected in the menu system when the page is reloaded. 

A section can be further divided into subsections and sub-subsections
using the following markup

<section title=" " label=" " >
      <subsection title=" " label=" " >
      		  <subsubsection title=" " label="">
		  </subsubsection >
      </subsection>
</section>

Though these subdivisions are not reflected in the menu.

Mathematical Content
----------------------------

Mathematical content can be added to text by surrounding standard
LaTeX 

      Some-text some-text $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ 

At this time only inline mathematics is supported.

Adding Code Snippets/Samples
---------------------------------------

To add inline code snippets, you should use the <code> tag specified

   text shsiej sjsi  <code>factor()</code> rh hrhr 

For longer pieces of code, the <verbatim> tag is provided.

    <verbatim>
    sage: test(x^2 + 1) 
    x^2+1
    </verbatim>

The verbatim environment is displayed in the web page exactly as it is formatted in the source.


Adding Images
-------------------

Images can be added by using the <image/> tag as follows

       <image height=" " width=" " alt="  "  src="path/to/file.png"  /> 

All of the attributes listed above  must be used.


Adding Links
-------------------

Links are specified using the <link> tag


Lists
-----------------

Numbered lists are created by using the <enumeration> tag

	 <enumeration>
		<item>  </item>
	 </enumeration>

Bullet-ed lists are specified using the <list> tag

	  <list>
		<item> </item> 
	  </list>


References/Bibliography
-------------------------------

The sites bibliography is specified by the <bibliography> tag. Each item is specified by the <bibitem> tag. 

    <bibliography>
	<bibitem label="sageweb">Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software http://sagemath.org</bibitem>
    </bibliography>

To reference the bibliography item in the text we use the <ref> tag with the label attribute given in the bibliography
   test sjdj sjsjk <ref>sageweb</ref> heheh hehe eh
